Yes you read it right, an ultimate blog. I know every web developer wants to create his own website, using tech he wants, design he desire and feature he needs.

That is exactly what I'm gonna do, I challange myself to create my own blog without another people template, by using a tech stack of Next js, Typescript, Material-ui and so on. Spesifically, it has to be using :

- React Js (I love this one)
- SEO (SSR to be, I hope it works fine)
- Containt my profile and portfolio

At this moment, I can't let my self not to code everyday, so I always spend a line or two codes in some projects. I believe I can be a better developer and better in managing my time.

So that is it! Let's see what the result would like from time to time.

Salam, Sami :)
