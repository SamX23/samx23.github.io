I created this to make sure not to be forgotten about what would I like to implement on this blog.

As you know, I have using dark mode but not all of the styling changes, since the implementation is still limited by my knowledge. But as soon as I get it, should be very beautifully themed.

So here is the list :

- React Context
- Better theming switch for dark and light
- PWA (For what ?)
- Shows up on google (blog and pages)
- Github API pages
- Animation
- Profile
- GraphQL (still learning)
- Add license

Well, that is all, I am surely will update this article if any change log occurs. Thank you for the time :)
