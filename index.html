          <p>October 2022 to Present</p>
          <p>
            Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege of contributing to
            impactful projects. I played a part in the development of a
            cross-platform healthcare application and modern landing pages,
            utilizing Next.js, TypeScript, and GraphQL. Additionally, I had the
            opportunity to contribute to the creation of a purposeful dashboard
            for healthcare applications, using Nuxt.js, TypeScript, and GraphQL.
            <br />
            <br />
            In recent responsibilities, I've been fortunate to work on diverse
            projectsâ€”a landing page, dashboard app, and cross-platform appâ€”all
            built with Next.js. These were supported by microservices using
            GraphQL, forming a technology stack that I'm truly grateful to
            engage with.
            <br />
            <br />
            I also had experience to do a bit of dev ops using Docker and
            Jenkins, managing mobile app release from scratch on Apple Store and
            Play Store, play around with the Google product such as Firebase
            Authentication, FCM, Firebase console and Google Analytics.
            <br />
            <br />
            I work in collaboration with team members from various countries
            such as India, France, Philippine, and Hong Kong.

        <p>April 2021 - October 2021</p>
        <p>
          As a participant in a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp, I gained
          experience in various aspects of web application development,
          including Front End, Back End, Continuous Integration/Continuous
          Deployment (CI/CD), Testing, and Deployment, all while following Scrum
          methodology. Throughout the bootcamp, I utilized React and Next.js to
          develop the Front End and Firebase and Postgres to build the Back End.
          The ultimate task was to develop a full-stack web app for games,
          comprising landing pages, a dashboard, and a games page.
